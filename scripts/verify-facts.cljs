;;
;; THE CENTRAL PROBLEM ON THIS REGISTER'S HOSTS: THE CHALLENGE IS A 2xx.
;;
;; www.meti.go.jp is behind AWS WAF. To an automated client it serves, instead
;; of the page, a 2468-byte JavaScript challenge carrying
;; window.awsWafCookieDomainList and window.gokuProps. That response answers
;; HTTP **202** -- a 2xx -- at the requested URL, with no redirect, and with an
;; EMPTY <title>.
;;
;; Every layer of an ordinary page check reads that as success except the last:
;;   status  202 is 2xx                          -> pass
;;   final   served at the requested URL         -> pass
;;   charset declared utf-8, served utf-8        -> pass
;;   title   "" vs the expected title            -> MISMATCH
;;
;; A verifier that stops there calls it title drift and exits 1, reporting
;; "the register is wrong" about a run that never reached the authority. The
;; register is not wrong; the run could not answer. So the challenge is
;; detected by its own signature BEFORE the status branch, and reported as
;; :challenge-interposed with verdict :refused -- exit 2.
;;
;; This is the same defect class this workspace keeps finding in other shapes:
;; a check that could not run returning the value of a check that ran clean.
;; Here it would have run the other way -- a check that could not run returning
;; the value of a check that ran and FAILED -- which is just as wrong and
;; sends whoever reads it to edit a register that was correct.
;;
;; FETCHES ARE SERIAL AND PACED, AND THAT IS A MEASUREMENT, NOT A STYLE.
;; The sibling MLIT verifier fetches every page concurrently with p/all. Doing
;; that here is what TRIPS the challenge: measured 2026-08-26, a cold client
;; reads real pages, roughly ten requests trips the WAF, and it then holds for
;; about four and a half minutes. A concurrent verifier would reliably produce
;; the failure it is meant to detect. Pages are therefore fetched one at a time
;; with --pace milliseconds between them.
;;
;; ALL FOUR HOSTS ANSWER 403, NOT 404, FOR A PATH THAT DOES NOT EXIST.
;; Each serves a real Japanese "this page does not exist" body at the requested
;; URL. 403 is not 2xx so status still discriminates, but a checker looking for
;; 404 specifically, or one reading 403 as "blocked, cannot measure", would
;; misreport four hosts that answered clearly. The status each host actually
;; returned is pinned in :host/missing-status and compared on every run.
;;
;; SIX SELF-TESTS, EACH ASSERTING THE REASON AND NOT THE VERDICT.
;; A negative test that only asserts "it went red" counts a run that went red
;; for an unrelated cause as a discriminating one. Each self-test below drives
;; the real check function and requires a specific :reason keyword back:
;;
;;   :nonexistent-law       an invented law id must not resolve
;;   :title-drift           a real page with the wrong expected title
;;   :unexpected-redirect   a URL that lands somewhere else than it asked for
;;   :missing-text          a real page missing a sentinel string
;;   :charset-drift         a UTF-8 page declared as Shift_JIS
;;   :challenge-interposed  the WAF challenge body must classify as a challenge
;;
;; The charset self-test declares a real UTF-8 page as Shift_JIS rather than
;; needing a non-UTF-8 page in the register, because no host cited here serves
;; one. The challenge self-test runs against a fixture of the real challenge
;; body rather than against the live WAF, because whether the WAF is engaged at
;; any moment is not under this run's control -- a self-test that only
;; discriminates when a third party happens to be blocking us is a self-test
;; that passes by not running.
;;
;; If any of them does not come back with its own reason, the run exits 2 and
;; reports nothing about the register.
;;
;; THE REASON IS PRINTED, NOT JUST THE VERDICT.
;; Every non-pass line carries its :reason in brackets -- FAIL[charset-drift],
;; not bare FAIL -- so an outside harness can tell which check fired.
;;
;; THE LAW LOOKUPS ARE PACED TOO. Running this in a tight loop (a mutation
;; suite, say) makes laws.e-gov.go.jp start answering HTML instead of JSON.
;; That is reported as REFUSED, not as a pass and not as a register error,
;; because a throttled run establishes nothing either way.
;;
;; WHY fetch AND NOT curl. Some go.jp hosts answer 403 to curl over both HTTP/2
;; and HTTP/1.1, with or without a browser User-Agent, while answering 200 with
;; full content to fetch at the same moment -- the block is on the TLS
;; fingerprint. A curl-based verifier records a reachable authority as
;; permanently unreachable and looks like it measured that. It measured its own
;; client.
